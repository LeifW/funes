Dependencies (these are pulled in for you by sbt):
 Scalatra (minimalist web framework inspired by Sinatra)
 https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra

 Scardf (DSL wrapper for Jena)
 http://code.google.com/p/scardf

To get started:
* Install SBT if you don't have it already (see http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup .  You just run java -jar sbt.jar or make a script to do that for you.
git clone http://github.com/LeifW/funes.git

cd funes
sbt
update (to pull in the listed dependencies)
jetty-run

It should compile and fire up a web server on port 8080.
Run "test" in sbt to run some tests.
The main source is in src/main/scala/info/funesrdf/
When you start hacking, running something like ~compile, ~test, or ~prepare-webapp are useful commands in sbt - any time a file is saved, they'll recompile, test, or restart the running webapp.
